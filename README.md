# NBAShots

## Project overview
The use of data analytics and machine learning has fundamentally changed the way basketball is played professionally. Optimized models can predict, with some accuracy, whether certain factors will influence the likelihood of a shot, or field goal, will be made. Any information that can be gained from EDA and modeling is extremely helpful for this competitive industry, so the aim of this present project is to predict if an NBA shot will be made or missed based off of easily recorded information about the game. The goal of this study is to predict if a shot is made correctly at least 60% of the time and find the best model to do so using model evaluations like accuracy score but also training and testing time complexity, since basketball is such a quick moving sport.
